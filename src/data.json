My curiosity about the interaction between hardware and software, and their role in AI development, stems from my interest in Mathematics and Computer programming. After living in Nigeria for almost a decade, I have come to understand the negative impact of the digital divide. My passion lies in bridging this gap and promoting technological growth in rural areas.",
